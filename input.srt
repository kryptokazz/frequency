00:57:30,114 --> 00:57:32,241
Neither desire to be with them...

687
00:57:32,491 --> 00:57:35,578
...because their minds
studieth robberies...

688
00:57:35,828 --> 00:57:38,747
...and their lips speak deceits."

689
00:57:38,998 --> 00:57:42,501
If thou lose hope, being weary
in the days of distress...

690
00:57:42,751 --> 00:57:45,004
...thy strength
shall be diminished.

691
00:57:45,254 --> 00:57:46,922
Fine, my son. Fine.

692
00:57:47,173 --> 00:57:48,424
Father?

693
00:57:52,470 --> 00:57:54,221
I have tried, have I not?

694
00:57:54,472 --> 00:57:55,556
You have, my son.

695
00:57:55,806 --> 00:57:58,142
- I've done my best, have I not?
- Indeed.

696
00:57:58,392 --> 00:58:01,770
I've never been guilty of any
institutional infraction, have I?

697
00:58:02,021 --> 00:58:06,358
You certainly have not, 655321.
You've been very helpful.

698
00:58:06,609 --> 00:58:09,487
And you've shown
a genuine desire to reform.

699
00:58:09,737 --> 00:58:11,030
Father...

700
00:58:12,490 --> 00:58:15,284
...can I ask you
a question in private?

701
00:58:16,911 --> 00:58:18,829
Certainly, my son. Certainly.

702
00:58:29,006 --> 00:58:31,550
Is there something
troubling you, my son?

703
00:58:34,678 --> 00:58:36,972
Don't be shy to speak up.

704
00:58:39,475 --> 00:58:40,809
Remember...

705
00:58:41,060 --> 00:58:43,020
...I know of the...

706
00:58:43,270 --> 00:58:47,107
...urges that can
trouble young men...

707
00:58:47,358 --> 00:58:48,859
...deprived...

708
00:58:49,109 --> 00:58:51,111
...of the society of women.

709
00:58:52,279 --> 00:58:53,822
Oh, Father.

710
00:58:53,989 --> 00:58:56,325
It's nothing like that, Father.

711
00:59:00,079 --> 00:59:03,457
It's about this new thing
they're all talking about.

712
00:59:03,999 --> 00:59:05,668
About this new treatment.

713
00:59:05,918 --> 00:59:08,254
It gets you out of prison
in no time.

714
00:59:08,504 --> 00:59:11,090
And makes sure you
never get back in again.

715
00:59:11,882 --> 00:59:14,134
Where did you hear about this?

716
00:59:14,385 --> 00:59:17,054
Who's been talking
about these things?

717
00:59:17,346 --> 00:59:19,765
These things get around.

718
00:59:20,015 --> 00:59:22,268
Two warders talk, as it might be.

719
00:59:22,518 --> 00:59:25,563
And somebody can't help
overhearing what they say.

720
00:59:26,105 --> 00:59:29,483
Then somebody picks up a scrap
of newspaper in the workshops...

721
00:59:29,733 --> 00:59:32,319
...and the newspaper
tells all about it.

722
00:59:35,281 --> 00:59:38,993
How about putting me in
for this new treatment?

723
00:59:40,619 --> 00:59:41,704
I take it...

724
00:59:41,954 --> 00:59:44,290
...you are referring...

725
00:59:44,540 --> 00:59:46,792
...to the Ludovico Technique.

726
00:59:47,543 --> 00:59:49,878
I don't know what it's called.

727
00:59:50,129 --> 00:59:52,006
I just know it
gets you out quickly...

728
00:59:52,256 --> 00:59:54,758
...and makes sure you
never get back in again.

729
00:59:55,467 --> 00:59:58,304
That is not proven, 655321.

730
00:59:58,554 --> 01:00:02,725
In fact, it is only in the
experimental stage at this moment.

731
01:00:03,183 --> 01:00:05,936
It is being used, isn't it, Father?

732
01:00:06,186 --> 01:00:08,939
It has not been used
in this prison yet.

733
01:00:09,189 --> 01:00:11,650
The governor has grave
doubts about it.

734
01:00:11,900 --> 01:00:15,613
And I've heard there are
very serious dangers involved.

735
01:00:17,615 --> 01:00:20,451
I don't care about the dangers.

736
01:00:22,161 --> 01:00:24,330
I just want to be good.

737
01:00:25,581 --> 01:00:28,250
I want for the rest
of my life to be...

738
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:30,586
...one act of goodness.

739
01:00:30,836 --> 01:00:32,296
The question is...

740
01:00:32,713 --> 01:00:34,465
...whether or not this technique...

741
01:00:34,715 --> 01:00:37,343
...really makes a man good.

742
01:00:38,177 --> 01:00:40,471
Goodness comes from within.

743
01:00:40,721 --> 01:00:41,847
Goodness...

744
01:00:42,097 --> 01:00:43,474
...is chosen.

745
01:00:43,849 --> 01:00:45,976
When a man cannot choose...

746
01:00:46,226 --> 01:00:48,354
...he ceases to be a man.

747
01:00:50,147 --> 01:00:52,024
I don't understand...

748
01:00:52,274 --> 01:00:55,069
...about the whys and wherefores.

749
01:00:56,278 --> 01:00:59,198
I only know I want to be good.

750
01:01:01,325 --> 01:01:03,243
Be patient, my son.

751
01:01:03,494 --> 01:01:05,746
Put your trust in the Lord.

752
01:01:07,665 --> 01:01:11,251
Instruct thy son
and he shall refresh thee...

753
01:01:11,502 --> 01:01:14,380
...and shall give delight
to thy soul.

754
01:01:15,005 --> 01:01:16,256
Amen.

755
01:01:43,951 --> 01:01:45,951
CHIEF: Mister!
GUARD: All present and correct, sir!

756
01:01:46,120 --> 01:01:47,162
CHIEF:
Right!

757
01:01:48,789 --> 01:01:50,874
All present and correct!

758
01:02:46,430 --> 01:02:47,973
CHIEF:
Prisoners, halt!

759
01:02:48,515 --> 01:02:50,142
Now pay attention!

760
01:02:50,851 --> 01:02:52,561
I want you in two lines...

761
01:02:52,853 --> 01:02:55,522
...up against that wall,
facing this way.

762
01:02:55,731 --> 01:02:57,316
Go on, move!

763
01:02:57,816 --> 01:02:58,817
Hurry up!

764
01:02:59,026 --> 01:03:00,360
Stop talking!

765
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:08,744
Prisoners ready
for inspection, sir!

766
01:03:24,718 --> 01:03:25,886
MINISTER:
How many to a cell?

767
01:03:26,178 --> 01:03:28,055
GOVERNOR:
Four in this block, sir.

768
01:03:28,889 --> 01:03:31,183
MINISTER: Cram criminals together
and what do you get?

769
01:03:31,391 --> 01:03:34,561
Concentrated criminality.
Crime in the midst of punishment.

770
01:03:34,853 --> 01:03:38,524
GOVERNOR: I agree, sir. We need
larger prisons, more money.

771
01:03:38,732 --> 01:03:40,567
MINISTER:
Not a chance, my dear fellow.

772
01:03:40,776 --> 01:03:43,111
The government can't be
concerned any longer...

773
01:03:43,403 --> 01:03:45,072
...with outmoded
penalogical theories.

774
01:03:45,405 --> 01:03:49,034
Soon we may need all prison
space for political offenders.

775
01:03:49,243 --> 01:03:52,788
Common criminals are best dealt
with on a purely curative basis.

776
01:03:53,080 --> 01:03:55,749
Kill the criminal reflex,
that's all.

777
01:03:56,041 --> 01:03:58,252
Full implementation
in a year's time.

778
01:03:58,502 --> 01:04:00,754
Punishment means nothing to them.

779
01:04:01,004 --> 01:04:03,924
They enjoy their
so-called punishment.

780
01:04:04,216 --> 01:04:05,376
You're absolutely right, sir.

781
01:04:05,592 --> 01:04:08,136
Shut your bleeding hole!

782
01:04:08,762 --> 01:04:10,305
MINISTER:
Who said that?

783
01:04:10,931 --> 01:04:12,391
I did, sir.

784
01:04:18,605 --> 01:04:20,315
What crime did you commit?

785
01:04:20,607 --> 01:04:22,651
The accidental killing
of a person, sir.

786
01:04:22,943 --> 01:04:25,612
He brutally murdered a woman
in furtherance of theft.

787
01:04:25,904 --> 01:04:27,531
Fourteen years, sir.

788
01:04:28,782 --> 01:04:29,950
Excellent.

789
01:04:31,535 --> 01:04:32,661
He's enterprising...

790
01:04:32,953 --> 01:04:34,037
...aggressive...

791
01:04:34,288 --> 01:04:35,455
...outgoing...

792
01:04:35,664 --> 01:04:38,083
...young, bold...

793
01:04:38,292 --> 01:04:39,793
...vicious.

794
01:04:40,294 --> 01:04:41,336
He'll do.

795
01:04:41,628 --> 01:04:42,754
Fine.

796
01:04:42,963 --> 01:04:44,464
We could still look at C-block.

797
01:04:44,756 --> 01:04:46,800
No, no. That's enough.
He's perfect.

798
01:04:47,050 --> 01:04:48,760
I want his records sent to me.

799
01:04:48,969 --> 01:04:50,304
This vicious young hoodlum...

800
01:04:50,596 --> 01:04:52,472
...will be transformed
out of all recognition.

801
01:04:52,764 --> 01:04:54,683
Thank you very much
for this chance.

802
01:04:54,975 --> 01:04:57,769
Let's hope you make
the most of it, my boy.

803
01:04:58,061 --> 01:05:00,564
- Shall we go to my office?
- Thank you.

804
01:05:06,111 --> 01:05:07,112
[KNOCK ON DOOR]

805
01:05:07,321 --> 01:05:08,655
Come in.

806
01:05:10,449 --> 01:05:13,368
Sir! 655321. Sir!

807
01:05:13,660 --> 01:05:14,661
Very good, chief.

808
01:05:14,870 --> 01:05:16,455
Over to the line.
Toes behind it.

809
01:05:16,663 --> 01:05:19,166
Full name and number
to the governor.

810
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:23,211
Alexander DeLarge, sir.
655321, sir.

811
01:05:25,881 --> 01:05:29,009
I don't suppose you know who
that was this morning.

812
01:05:29,301 --> 01:05:32,888
That was no less a personage
than the minister of the interior.

813
01:05:33,180 --> 01:05:35,140
The new minister of the interior.

814
01:05:35,349 --> 01:05:38,310
What they call a very new broom.

815
01:05:39,478 --> 01:05:42,898
These new ridiculous ideas
have come at last.

816
01:05:43,315 --> 01:05:45,609
And orders are orders.

817
01:05:45,859 --> 01:05:49,363
Though I may say to you
in confidence, I do not approve.

818
01:05:49,655 --> 01:05:51,865
An eye for an eye, I say.

819
01:05:52,157 --> 01:05:55,118
If someone hits you,
you hit back, do you not?

820
01:05:55,369 --> 01:05:59,039
Why should not the state,
severely hit by you hooligans...

821
01:05:59,331 --> 01:06:01,124
...not hit back also?

822
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:03,961
The new view is to say "no."

823
01:06:04,211 --> 01:06:07,547
The new view is that
we turn the bad into good.

824
01:06:07,839 --> 01:06:10,801
All of which seems to me
to be grossly unjust.

825
01:06:11,218 --> 01:06:13,762
- Sir, I--
- Shut your filthy hole, you scum!

826
01:06:14,221 --> 01:06:16,390
You are to be reformed.

827
01:06:17,265 --> 01:06:19,768
Tomorrow you will go
to this man, Brodsky.

828
01:06:20,018 --> 01:06:21,561
You will be leaving here.

829
01:06:21,853 --> 01:06:26,066
You will be transferred to
the Ludovico medical facility.

830
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:28,068
It's believed you'll be able...

831
01:06:28,318 --> 01:06:30,320
...to leave state custody
in a fortnight.

832
01:06:30,570 --> 01:06:32,406
I suppose that prospect
pleases you?

833
01:06:32,698 --> 01:06:34,491
Answer the governor's question!

834
01:06:34,741 --> 01:06:36,076
Yes, sir.
Thank you very much.

835
01:06:36,326 --> 01:06:38,662
I've done my best here,
I really have, sir.

836
01:06:38,912 --> 01:06:41,164
I'm very grateful
to all concerned, sir.

837
01:06:43,375 --> 01:06:45,794
Sign this where it's marked.

838
01:06:48,922 --> 01:06:51,008
Don't read it, sign it!

839
01:06:51,299 --> 01:06:54,928
It says you're willing to have
your sentence commuted...

840
01:06:55,220 --> 01:06:58,181
...to submission to
the Ludovico treatment.

841
01:06:58,432 --> 01:06:59,766
And this.

842
01:07:06,940 --> 01:07:08,525
And another copy.

843
01:07:21,079 --> 01:07:22,914
ALEX:
<i>The next morning I was taken to...</i>

844
01:07:23,123 --> 01:07:24,833
<i>...the Ludovico medical facility...</i>

845
01:07:25,042 --> 01:07:26,877
<i>...outside the town center.</i>

846
01:07:27,127 --> 01:07:28,628
<i>I felt a malenky bit sad...</i>

847
01:07:28,879 --> 01:07:30,797
<i>...having to say goodbye
to the old Staja...</i>

848
01:07:31,048 --> 01:07:34,301
<i>...as you will, when you leave
a place you've gotten used to.</i>

849
01:07:34,551 --> 01:07:36,344
Right, hold the prisoner.

850
01:07:42,017 --> 01:07:44,478
Good morning, sir.
I'm Chief Officer Barnes.

851
01:07:44,728 --> 01:07:46,521
I've got 655321...

852
01:07:46,772 --> 01:07:50,442
...on a transfer from Parkmoor
to the Ludovico Centre, sir.

853
01:07:50,776 --> 01:07:53,361
Good morning.
Yes, we've been expecting you.

854
01:07:53,612 --> 01:07:54,905
I'm Dr. Alcot.

855
01:07:56,823 --> 01:07:58,033
Dr. Alcot. Very good, sir.

856
01:08:03,538 --> 01:08:06,666
- Are you prepared for the prisoner?
- Yes, of course.

857
01:08:06,917 --> 01:08:10,921
I wonder if you'd mind signing
these documents, sir.

858
01:08:11,797 --> 01:08:13,215
There, sir.

859
01:08:24,684 --> 01:08:26,103
And there, sir.

860
01:08:31,566 --> 01:08:33,151
And there.

861
01:08:38,532 --> 01:08:40,158
Here you go.

862
01:08:52,087 --> 01:08:53,630
There you are.

863
01:08:55,757 --> 01:08:57,676
Prison escort, move forward!

864
01:09:00,846 --> 01:09:02,013
Halt!

865
01:09:04,099 --> 01:09:05,809
Excuse me, sir.

866
01:09:12,357 --> 01:09:15,610
Is that the officer that is
to take charge of the prisoner?

867
01:09:25,162 --> 01:09:28,665
A word of advice, doc.
You'll have to watch this one.

868
01:09:28,915 --> 01:09:32,460
A right brutal bastard he has been,
and will be again...

869
01:09:32,711 --> 01:09:35,881
...in spite of all his sucking up
and reading the Bible.

870
01:09:36,131 --> 01:09:39,801
We can manage things.
Show the young man to his room.

871
01:09:40,051 --> 01:09:42,804
Right, sir. Come this way, please.

872
01:09:51,563 --> 01:09:54,107
- Morning, Charlie.
- Good morning, doctor.

873
01:09:55,400 --> 01:09:56,443
BRANOM:
Good morning, Alex.

874
01:09:56,651 --> 01:09:59,279
My name is Dr. Branom.
I'm Dr. Brodsky's assistant.

875
01:09:59,529 --> 01:10:01,114
Good morning, missus.
Lovely day.

876
01:10:01,406 --> 01:10:02,616
Indeed, it is.

877
01:10:02,908 --> 01:10:04,451
May I take that?

878
01:10:08,121 --> 01:10:10,624
- How are you feeling?
- Fine, fine.

879
01:10:10,916 --> 01:10:13,835
Good. In a few minutes
you'll meet Dr. Brodsky...

880
01:10:14,127 --> 01:10:15,420
...and begin your treatment.

881
01:10:15,962 --> 01:10:19,174
You're a very lucky boy
to have been chosen.

882
01:10:19,341 --> 01:10:22,969
ALEX: I realize that,
and I'm very grateful to all concerned.

883
01:10:23,303 --> 01:10:25,472
We're going to be friends,
aren't we?

884
01:10:25,680 --> 01:10:27,057
ALEX:
I hope so, missus.

885
01:10:30,143 --> 01:10:32,604
What's the hypo for?
Sending me to sleep?

886
01:10:32,812 --> 01:10:34,147
BRANOM:
Nothing of the sort.

887
01:10:34,606 --> 01:10:37,317
- Vitamins will it be, then?
- Something like that.

888
01:10:37,817 --> 01:10:39,152
You're undernourished.

889
01:10:39,361 --> 01:10:41,780
So after each meal
we'll give you a shot.

890
01:10:41,988 --> 01:10:43,490
Roll over on your right side.

891
01:10:43,698 --> 01:10:46,576
Loosen your pajama pants
and pull them halfway down.

892
01:10:56,503 --> 01:10:59,506
What exactly is the treatment here
going to be, then?

893
01:11:00,632 --> 01:11:02,467
It's quite simple, really.

894
01:11:03,009 --> 01:11:04,844
We're going to show you some films.

895
01:11:05,095 --> 01:11:07,389
You mean like
going to the pictures?

896
01:11:07,722 --> 01:11:09,349
Something like that.

897
01:11:09,641 --> 01:11:13,520
That's good. I like to viddy
the old films now and again.

898
01:11:15,522 --> 01:11:18,024
ALEX:
<i>And viddy films I would.</i>

899
01:11:18,525 --> 01:11:20,485
<i>Where I was taken to, brothers...</i>

900
01:11:20,694 --> 01:11:22,862
<i>...was like no cine
I ever viddied before.</i>

901
01:11:23,321 --> 01:11:25,407
<i>I was bound up
in a straitjacket...</i>

902
01:11:25,699 --> 01:11:27,867
<i>...and my gulliver was strapped
to a headrest...</i>

903
01:11:28,159 --> 01:11:30,412
<i>...with wires running away from it.</i>

904
01:11:30,704 --> 01:11:32,998
<i>Then they clamped, like,
lid-locks on me eyes...</i>

905
01:11:33,206 --> 01:11:36,710
<i>...so that I could not shut them,
no matter how hard I tried.</i>

906
01:11:36,918 --> 01:11:38,712
<i>It seemed a bit crazy to me...</i>

907
01:11:38,920 --> 01:11:41,840
<i>...but I let them get on with
what they wanted to get on with.</i>

908
01:11:42,048 --> 01:11:45,427
<i>If I was to be a free malchick
again in a fortnight...</i>

909
01:11:45,719 --> 01:11:49,139
<i>...I would put up with much
in the meantime, my brothers.</i>

910
01:12:14,581 --> 01:12:17,917
<i>The first film was a very good,
professional piece of cine...</i>

911
01:12:18,209 --> 01:12:20,086
<i>...like it was done in Hollywood.</i>

912
01:12:20,378 --> 01:12:22,464
<i>The sounds were real horrorshow.</i>

913
01:12:22,756 --> 01:12:25,925
<i>You could slooshy the screams
and moans very realistic.</i>

914
01:12:26,176 --> 01:12:28,428
<i>You could even get
the breathing and panting...</i>

915
01:12:28,720 --> 01:12:31,681
<i>...of the tolchocking malchicks
at the same time.</i>

916
01:12:31,931 --> 01:12:33,767
<i>And then what do you know?</i>

917
01:12:34,059 --> 01:12:36,186
<i>Soon our dear old friend...</i>

918
01:12:36,436 --> 01:12:38,438
<i>...the red, red vino on tap...</i>

919
01:12:38,688 --> 01:12:39,808
<i>...the same in all places...</i>

920
01:12:40,065 --> 01:12:41,625
<i>...like it's put out
by the same firm...</i>

921
01:12:42,108 --> 01:12:43,693
<i>...began to flow.</i>

922
01:12:43,943 --> 01:12:46,112
<i>It was beautiful.</i>

923
01:12:46,446 --> 01:12:48,782
<i>It's funny how the colors
of the real world...</i>

924
01:12:49,199 --> 01:12:50,992
<i>...only seem really real...</i>

925
01:12:51,284 --> 01:12:53,453
<i>...when you viddy them
on a screen.</i>

926
01:12:56,414 --> 01:12:58,833
<i>Now, all the time
I was watching this...</i>

927
01:12:59,125 --> 01:13:01,336
<i>...I was beginning
to get very aware...</i>

928
01:13:01,628 --> 01:13:03,797
<i>...of, like, not feeling
all that well.</i>

929
01:13:04,005 --> 01:13:07,926
<i>And this I put down
to all the rich food and vitamins.</i>

930
01:13:08,134 --> 01:13:12,472
<i>But I tried to forget this,
concentrating on the next film...</i>

931
01:13:12,764 --> 01:13:15,433
<i>...which jumped right away
on a young devotchka...</i>

932
01:13:15,642 --> 01:13:18,478
<i>...who was being given
the old in-out, in-out...</i>

933
01:13:19,354 --> 01:13:21,481
<i>...first by one malchick...</i>

934
01:13:22,315 --> 01:13:23,483
<i>...then another.</i>

935
01:13:24,484 --> 01:13:26,111
<i>Then another.</i>

936
01:13:29,030 --> 01:13:31,491
<i>When it came to
the 6th or 7th malchick...</i>

937
01:13:31,741 --> 01:13:35,245
<i>...leering and smecking
and then going into it...</i>

938
01:13:35,495 --> 01:13:38,665
<i>...I began to feel really sick.</i>

939
01:13:39,249 --> 01:13:41,835
<i>But I could not shut me glazzies.</i>

940
01:13:42,043 --> 01:13:45,505
<i>And even if I tried to move
my glazzballs about...</i>

941
01:13:45,755 --> 01:13:47,757
<i>...I still could not get out of...</i>

942
01:13:48,007 --> 01:13:50,677
<i>...the line of fire
of this picture.</i>

943
01:13:53,388 --> 01:13:55,014
Get me up.

944
01:13:55,348 --> 01:13:57,183
I'm going to be sick.

945
01:13:58,184 --> 01:14:00,186
Get something for me to be sick in!

946
01:14:04,524 --> 01:14:07,360
Very soon now,
the drug will cause the subject...

947
01:14:07,569 --> 01:14:09,863
...to experience
a deathlike paralysis...

948
01:14:10,071 --> 01:14:13,408
...together with deep feelings
of terror and helplessness.

949
01:14:13,575 --> 01:14:16,578
ALEX: I can't stand it anymore.
- One of our early test subjects...

950
01:14:16,870 --> 01:14:18,663
...described it as being like death.

951
01:14:18,872 --> 01:14:21,833
A sense of stifling or drowning.

952
01:14:22,542 --> 01:14:25,211
And it is during this period,
we have found...

953
01:14:25,503 --> 01:14:29,090
...the subject will make
his most rewarding associations...

954
01:14:29,382 --> 01:14:33,094
...between his catastrophic
experience, environment...

955
01:14:33,386 --> 01:14:35,722
...and the violence he sees.

956
01:14:35,889 --> 01:14:37,098
ALEX:
Leave me glazzies!

957
01:14:38,016 --> 01:14:40,226
Dr. Brodsky is pleased with you.

958
01:14:40,435 --> 01:14:42,854
You've made
a very positive response.

959
01:14:43,938 --> 01:14:47,859
Tomorrow there will be two
sessions, morning and afternoon.

960
01:14:48,067 --> 01:14:51,070
You mean I have to viddy
two sessions in one day?

961
01:14:51,362 --> 01:14:54,532
I imagine you'll feel a bit
limp by the end of the day.

962
01:14:54,741 --> 01:14:58,077
But we have to be hard on you.
You have to be cured.

963
01:14:58,369 --> 01:14:59,412
It was horrible.

964
01:14:59,621 --> 01:15:01,247
Of course it was horrible.

965
01:15:01,456 --> 01:15:03,917
Violence is a very horrible thing.

966
01:15:04,125 --> 01:15:05,877
That's what you're learning now.

967
01:15:06,085 --> 01:15:07,378
Your body's learning it.

968
01:15:07,962 --> 01:15:10,757
I just don't understand about
feeling sick the way I did.

969
01:15:10,965 --> 01:15:14,260
I never used to feel sick.
I used to feel the very opposite.

970
01:15:14,469 --> 01:15:17,430
Doing it or watching it,
I used to feel real horrorshow.

971
01:15:18,348 --> 01:15:21,768
You felt ill this afternoon
because you're getting better.

972
01:15:22,060 --> 01:15:25,230
When we're healthy,
we respond to the hateful...

973
01:15:25,438 --> 01:15:27,440
...with fear and nausea.

974
01:15:27,732 --> 01:15:29,901
You're becoming healthy,
that's all.

975
01:15:30,109 --> 01:15:33,279
By this time tomorrow,
you'll be healthier still.

<i>...while they flashed nasty bits
of ultra-violence on the screen...</i>

983

<i>...though not on the soundtrack,

It's a sin!

It's a sin!

It's a sin! It's a sin! It's a sin!

998
01:17:28,853 --> 01:17:29,896
Sin?

999
01:17:30,188 --> 01:17:31,731
What's all this about sin?

1000
01:17:32,231 --> 01:17:37,403
That! Using Ludwig van like that.
He did no harm to anyone.

1001
01:17:37,612 --> 01:17:40,073
Beethoven just wrote music.

1002
01:17:40,740 --> 01:17:43,910
Are you referring
to the background score?

1003
01:17:44,243 --> 01:17:47,413
- Yes!
- You've heard Beethoven before?

1004

Yes!

1005
01:17:49,624 --> 01:17:51,542
So you're keen on music?

1006
01:17:51,834 --> 01:17:53,252
Yes!

1007
01:17:56,923 --> 01:17:58,633
Can't be helped.

1008
01:17:59,425 --> 01:18:02,261
Here's the punishment
element perhaps.

1009
01:18:03,262 --> 01:18:05,348
The governor ought to be pleased.

This is for your own good.

1012

You'll have to bear with us
for a while.

1013

But it's not fair. It's not fair
I should feel ill when I hear...

...lovely, lovely Ludwig van.

1015
01:18:22,949 --> 01:18:25,284
You must take your chance, boy.

1016
01:18:25,702 --> 01:18:28,204
The choice has been all yours.

1017
01:18:29,706 --> 01:18:32,458
You needn't take it
any further, sir.

1018
01:18:32,792 --> 01:18:35,712
You've proved to me all this
ultra-violence and killing...

1019
01:18:35,962 --> 01:18:39,215
...is wrong, wrong
and terribly wrong!

1020

Missus!

1026
01:18:54,731 --> 01:18:56,858
I see that it's wrong!

1027
01:18:57,150 --> 01:19:01,154
It's wrong because
it's, like, against society.

1028
01:19:01,404 --> 01:19:04,115
Because everybody has the
right to live and be happy...

DOCTOR: That's quite all right,
minister. No trouble at all.

- Good evening, my boy.
ALEX: Hi there, my little droogies.

1716
02:08:15,146 --> 02:08:16,940
How're you getting on, young man?

1717
02:08:17,315 --> 02:08:19,526
Great, sir. Just great.

1718
02:08:20,318 --> 02:08:21,903
Can I do anything more for you?

1719
02:08:22,112 --> 02:08:23,905
I don't think so, Sir Leslie.

1720
02:08:24,114 --> 02:08:26,783
Then I leave you to it. Nurse.

1721
02:08:29,619 --> 02:08:32,914
You seem to have a whole ward
to yourself, my boy.

1722
02:08:33,123 --> 02:08:34,457
Yes, sir.

02:08:34,958 --> 02:08:37,293
And a very lonely place
it is too...

...when I wake up in the night
with me pain.

1725
02:08:40,422 --> 02:08:43,633
Yes. Anyway, good to see you
on the mend.

1726
02:08:43,925 --> 02:08:46,469
I kept in touch
with the hospital, of course.

1727
02:08:46,720 --> 02:08:48,555
And now I've come down
personally...

1728

...to see how you're getting along.

1729
02:08:50,849 --> 02:08:53,143
I've suffered the tortures
of the damned.

1730
02:08:53,351 --> 02:08:54,853
Tortures of the damned.

Yes, I can appreciate that
you've had an extremely--

1732

Oh, look. Let me help you
with that, shall I?

1733
02:09:01,359 --> 02:09:03,153
Thank you, sir. Thank you.

1734
02:09:03,361 --> 02:09:07,657
I can tell you that I, and the
government of which I'm a member...

1735
02:09:07,866 --> 02:09:11,828
...are deeply sorry about this,
my boy. Deeply sorry.

1736
02:09:12,036 --> 02:09:13,329
We tried to help you.

1737
02:09:13,538 --> 02:09:17,667
We followed recommendations
that turned out to be wrong.

responsibility where it belongs.

We never wished you harm.

But there are some who did, and do.

And I think you know who those are.

1745
02:09:38,772 --> 02:09:42,567
There are certain people who wanted
to use you for political ends.

1746
02:09:42,859 --> 02:09:45,195
They would have been
glad to have you dead...

1747
02:09:45,403 --> 02:09:48,573
...for they thought they could then
blame it on the government.

1748
02:09:49,199 --> 02:09:51,534
There is also a certain man...

1749
02:09:51,743 --> 02:09:54,245
...a writer of subversive
literature...

1750
02:09:54,537 --> 02:09:56,581
...who has been howling
for your blood.

1751
02:09:56,873 --> 02:10:00,251
He's been mad with desire
to stick a knife into you.

1752
02:10:00,710 --> 02:10:02,212
But you're safe from him now.

1753
02:10:02,504 --> 02:10:04,547
We put him away.

1754
02:10:06,424 --> 02:10:09,552
He found out that you
had done wrong to him.

1755
02:10:10,053 --> 02:10:12,555
At least he believed
you had done wrong.

1756
02:10:12,764 --> 02:10:17,018
He formed this idea in his head
that you had been responsible...

1757
02:10:17,227 --> 02:10:20,647
...for the death of someone
near and dear to him.

1758
02:10:21,564 --> 02:10:22,607
He was a menace.

1759
02:10:22,899 --> 02:10:25,026
We put him away
for his own protection.

1760
02:10:25,235 --> 02:10:26,569
And also for yours.

Where is he now?

1762
02:10:28,947 --> 02:10:32,408
We put him away

What job and how much?

1768
02:10:47,090 --> 02:10:51,052
You'll have an interesting job at
a salary you regard as adequate.

1769
02:10:51,261 --> 02:10:53,471
Not only for the job
you're going to do...

1770
02:10:53,763 --> 02:10:57,350
...and in compensation for what
you believe you have suffered...

you are helping us.

...has lost a lot of popularity
because of you, my boy.

1776
02:11:19,873 --> 02:11:23,293
There are some who think that at
the next election we shall be out.

1777
02:11:23,501 --> 02:11:26,212
The press has chosen to take
a very unfavorable view...

02:11:26,462 --> 02:11:27,881
...of what we tried to do.

1779
